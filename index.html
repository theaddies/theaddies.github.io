<p>My name is Andrew Addie. I am a father of 2 teenage daughters<br>
    who are both at university.  I was born in Melbourne, Australia<br>
    and moved to the southern United States at the age of 8.<br>
    I graduate from Georgia Tech with a bachelors degree in<br>
    Chemical Engineering and have a Master's degree also in Chemical<br>
    Engineering from the University of Delaware.  I have traveled<br>
    extensively around the world and lived in Italy for 1 year and<br>
    England for 3 years.
</p>

<p>My list of hobbies are quite lengthy.  Currently I am interested<br>
    in backpacking and camping.  I am also spending a lot of time<br>
    learning to program in my data analysis bootcamp with Case Western<br>
    Reserve University.  Other hobbies that I have enjoyed in the past<br>
    are electronics, computer networking, woodworking, biking and bike<br>
    touring and running.
