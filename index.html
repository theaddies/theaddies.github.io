<p>My name is Andrew Addie. I am a father of 2 teenage daughters who are both at university.
    I was born in Melbourne, Australia and moved to the southern United States at the age of 8.
    I graduate from Georgia Tech with a bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering and have a Master's degree
    in Chemical Engineering from the University of Delaware.  I have traveled extensively around the world
    and lived in Italy for 1 year and England for 3 years.
</p>

<p>My list of hobbies are quite lengthy.  Currently I am interested in backpacking and camping.
    I am also spending a lot of time learning to program in my data analysis bootcamp with
    Case Western Reserve University.  Other hobbies that I have enjoyed in the past
    are electronics, computer networking, woodworking, biking and bike touring and running.
